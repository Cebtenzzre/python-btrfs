In this directory you can find a collection of example scripts that use
python-btrfs to look up information about your btrfs filesystem. Over time,
some of these examples have been 'promoted' to actual utilities, which you can
find in the bin/ directory instead now.

Many of the scripts just use a btrfs mountpoint, or a combination of a vaddr
and mountpoint as argument. Run them without any of it, and they will tell you
what they expect.

More background information about every example can be found in the git commit
history of this project. Just find out when each of the files were added or
modified and when, and what other commits were done around that. Browsing
around in the commits will show a huge amount of documentation.

Have fun!
