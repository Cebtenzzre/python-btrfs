# The mounts options allows limiting the filesystems that are included in the
# plugin output, as well as forcing the path that is used in the graph title to
# a certain value. No fun stuff allowed. Either path cannot have spaces etc. in
# the name, because we simply split on a space. Also, any non-ascii character
# used might result in surprises. All of that is just not supported here.
#env.mounts / /foo /bar
